Playing around with the [BF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck) language in Haskell. This repo implements a BF interpreter that uses a comonad to represent the tape. It is therefore extremely inefficient and probably uninteresting to everyone except people who like Haskell.

I might add more to this eventually.
